# Modernization Plan

The `modern` branch is a rewrite of galaxyJSPAM as an installable, reproducible package.
This file records what has been decided. Items are added one at a time as they are decided.

## Scope
- Start by building around TNG → SPAM: simulate and optimize, for the TNG vs SPAM paper.
- Port only what that paper needs. The scope grows with the code. Image creation and
  machine scoring come later.

## Decided
- **Packaging:** `pyproject.toml` + `uv`. The lockfile is part of reproducibility.
- **Environment:** one Docker image, run with Apptainer on the cluster.
  - CUDA 12.x only (the cluster driver is 12.4)
  - Ubuntu 24.04
  - OpenMPI 4.1.6, matching the cluster
  - Built locally, pushed to Docker Hub, pulled on the cluster with `apptainer pull`
- **Data:** never in git; it lives outside the repo.
- **Input:** one config tree for everything that can change a result, plus a few runtime flags.
  - Config tree: one section per component (`run`, `simulator`, `fitness`, `ga`, …); `run`
    holds per-run values like target and seed.
  - Precedence: defaults in code (dataclasses) < JSON config file < command-line `key=value`
    overrides (e.g. `ga.population=128`).
  - Unknown keys or wrong types are an error. Each run saves its full merged config with its
    output.
  - Parameter studies are lists of override sets, one run per set.
  - Runtime flags (`argparse`) don't change results and stay outside the tree: `--config`, the
    override list, `--log-level`, `--mode`, output folder.
- **Testing:** `pytest`, with tests in `tests/`.
  - Compare numbers with `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`, not `==`.
  - Golden tests: save reference outputs once, compare later runs against them. Orbits match
    exactly; particle runs only statistically until the Fortran RNG takes a seed.
  - Mark long tests `@pytest.mark.slow` so quick runs can skip them.
  - Parallel code is tested in solo mode (built-in `map`); one small test checks the MPI pool
    under `mpiexec`.
  - Later: coverage (`pytest-cov`) and CI (GitHub Actions), once the Fortran build is settled.
- **Parallel:** code takes a `map` function (default: built-in `map`). The entry point picks it
  once from `--mode`:
  - solo: built-in `map`
  - local: `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`
  - MPI: `mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor`, launched with `python -m mpi4py.futures`

  Both pools hand out tasks dynamically, one at a time. Start simple; add per-task error
  capture and progress reporting later if needed.
  - The entry point creates the pool once and shuts it down at the end (`with`). It passes
    the pool's `map` down to the code that needs it.
  - Parallelize at one level only: the outermost loop with many independent tasks, each
    taking at least seconds (e.g. the models in one optimizer generation).
  - No nesting: a task running in a worker never starts its own pool.
  - The lowest level stays plain: functions like a single SPAM run know nothing about pools
    or MPI, so they can be tested and called on their own.
  - Parallelism above the pool comes from Slurm, not Python (e.g. a job array with one task
    per target, each running its own pool).
- **Logging:** Python's standard `logging` module, used throughout.
  - DEBUG logs trace what the code did; checks that a result is correct belong in tests.
  - DEBUG statements are kept for development and testing. They must cost almost nothing when
    DEBUG is off:
    - Lazy formatting: `logger.debug("x = %s", x)`, not f-strings or `%` inside log calls.
    - No logging inside tight loops (per particle, per time step); log summaries per run or
      per generation.
  - One logger per module: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Modules never configure logging.
  - Configure once at the entry point: the level comes from `--log-level`, and the format
    includes time, level, module, function and MPI rank. Quiet noisy libraries individually
    (e.g. `logging.getLogger("matplotlib").setLevel(logging.WARNING)`).
  - One log call per error: `logger.exception("...")` records the message and traceback,
    then raise. Don't log the same error again further up.

## Branches
- `modern`: created from `working_research`. The first commit cleared the old tree, so the
  old history is still reachable.
- `working_research`: stays in use for research until `modern` reaches parity.
- Old branches (`Master`, `old_master`) are kept as archive tags. Deleting them is not required.
- **At parity:** `modern` becomes `main`, `working_research` becomes `legacy`, and the GitHub
  default branch becomes `main`.

## To port
Science changes committed to `working_research` after `modern` was created
(2026-10-27, from `9f87fea`). Each one must also be made on `modern`.
