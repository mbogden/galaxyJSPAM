Tested with python 3.6 on Ubunut 18.04 VM and the included .deb versions of mysql direct from Oracle official channels
The official version worked, while the apt-get versions did not

Simple enough to install the connector, and the other .deb the same way:
sudo apt install ./mysql-apt-config_0.8.14-1_all.deb 
sudo apt install ./mysql-connector-python-py3_8.0.18-1ubuntu18.04_all.deb

I setup my user as 'root' with a highly secure password, 'password', and created a database "GALAXY"
Then I opened the interface:
mysql -u root -p 
 (Which then prompted me for the password)

Once in the sql interface console, I run: 
"source sqlInit.sql;" 
to setup the WEB table, but this only has to be done the first time ever after a clean install unless you delete/drop the table

After this, I leave the sql interface with 'exit'

Then I run the python file, but that's just there for examples for the website usage.
