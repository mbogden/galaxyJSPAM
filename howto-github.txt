# These are just a few basic functions for initial installation and commands I discovered myself using on a daily basis.


# Initial Installation to create your own local repository.

- Initial installation
git install https://github.com/mbogden/galaxyJSPAM.git


- Change branch.  There are two branches in the repository.  We would like to keep "master" as an always functional version of the product.  Switch to "Working" branch as you modify and develop files and stay on 'Working'.  I, Matthew, will maintain the updates and merges to 'master' for now.

- Lists branches
git branch

- Change to Working branch
git checkout Working



# Common/Daily Instructions

- Update your local repository.  As changes are made to the online repository you will need to update your own local repository to reflect those changes.   It's wise to do this frequently.

git pull


# Making changes.  As you modify files in the repository you will need to push those changes to other people.  This is done in two steps

- 1.  Make commits.  It's good practice to make a 'commit' whenever you create or change a file, even if it's a minor change.  It will save your progress and attach a note specifying the change.

git commit -m 'This is a comment.  Ex. Altered function Foo to file.c'

- 2. Push to online repository.  Commits are made to your local repository.  Pushing it out to the online repository will allow everyone to see and benefit from the changes.  It is wise to first pull from the repository before pushing your own changes or bad things may happen. 

git pull
git push



- If you make files and folders in your local repository, they are NOT automatically considered part of the online repository.  You have to specifically add them to become part of the repository.  Once added git will be sure to maintain and track changes.
